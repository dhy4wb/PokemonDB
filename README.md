# PokemonDB
CS 4750 Databases Project
Pokemon website used to retrieve information about pokemon and save favorite pokemon

### Notes (as of 4/23/2020)
* required files seem to only take effect when in another folder (in our case it was /inc)
* password hashing seems to not work in the database_functions.php file, but works in the login form, so is used there before verification
* navbar routing changes requires making changes to the controller.php
* environment variables were defined in app.yaml
